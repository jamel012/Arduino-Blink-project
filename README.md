# Arduino-Blink-project

This Arduino project blinks an LED only when a button is pressed. It uses non-blocking code with millis() instead of delay(), allowing better responsiveness and future expansion.


# What It Does
When the button is pressed, the LED starts blinking (turns on and off at a regular interval).

When the button is released, the LED stops blinking.

Uses delay(10) only to avoid overwhelming simulation or hardware — not for blinking.
